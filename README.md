# Python Module - Week Two Assignment

## 📌 Description
This program is part of the PLP Software Development Course, Week 2 Python Module Assignment.  
It demonstrates basic Python list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.

## 📝 Steps Implemented
1. Create an empty list.
2. Append the values 10, 20, 30, 40.
3. Insert the value 15 at the second position.
4. Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element from the list.
6. Sort the list in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value 30.

## 💻 Example Output
List of an empty list: []
List after appending elements: [10, 20, 30, 40]
List after extending with [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
List after removing the last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
List after sorting in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
